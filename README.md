# irctc Simulation
Simulation of railway traffic between two stations in indian railways. Data from data.gov.in, converted 24hr railway time table into arrival and departure inter arrivals and loaded them into Arena. Analyzed increase of platform number at which station would decrease traffic congestion the most. 
technologies - R for data wrangling , Arena for simulation , optquest for identifying optimal scenario by heuristic approach
conclusion - Increase of platform by 1 unit at station 2 is more effective compared to similar increase in station 1.
